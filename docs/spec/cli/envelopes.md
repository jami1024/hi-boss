# CLI: Envelopes

This document specifies `hiboss envelope ...`.

- `docs/spec/cli/reactions.md` (reacting to channel messages)

## `hiboss envelope send`

Sends an envelope to an agent or channel.

Flags:
- `--to <address>` (required)
- `--text <text>` or `--text -` (stdin) or `--text-file <path>`
- `--attachment <path>` (repeatable)
- `--reply-to <envelope-id>` (optional; adds thread context for agent↔agent envelopes; for channel destinations, also replies/quotes the referenced channel envelope when possible)
- `--work-item-id <id>` (optional; requirement context key for orchestration)
- `--work-item-state <state>` (optional; `new|triaged|in-progress|awaiting-user|blocked|done|archived`; requires `--work-item-id`)
- `--work-item-title <title>` (optional; requires `--work-item-id`)
- `--parse-mode <mode>` (optional; channel destinations only; `plain|markdownv2|html`)
- `--deliver-at <time>` (ISO 8601 or relative: `+2h`, `+30m`, `+1Y2M`, `-15m`; units: `Y/M/D/h/m/s`)

Notes:
- Sender identity is derived from the authenticated **agent token**.
- Boss tokens cannot send envelopes via `hiboss envelope send`; to message an agent as a human/boss, send via a channel adapter (e.g., Telegram).
- Sending to `agent:<name>` fails fast if the agent does not exist (`NOT_FOUND`) or the address is invalid (`INVALID_PARAMS`).
- When `--work-item-id` is present, the daemon upserts a persistent work item record (`work_items`) and mirrors optional `--work-item-state` / `--work-item-title` into that record.
- When `--work-item-state` is present and the work item already exists, transition must satisfy lifecycle guard rules.
- `--work-item-state done` requires sender role `leader`.
- For channel destinations with `--work-item-id`, Hi-Boss enforces a per-work-item channel allowlist:
  - first channel destination seeds the allowlist;
  - later sends to a new channel require `leader` role to expand the allowlist;
  - non-leader sends to non-allowlisted channels are rejected.
- Allowlist can be managed explicitly via `hiboss work-item update --add-channel/--remove-channel`.
- After explicit allowlist management, the work item enters strict allowlist mode:
  - non-leader sends can no longer auto-seed/expand channels;
  - removing all channels does not reopen auto-seeding for non-leader sends.

Output (parseable):

```
id: <envelope-id>  # short id
```

Default permission:
- `restricted`

## `hiboss envelope thread`

Prints the envelope chain from a target envelope up to its root (following `metadata.replyToEnvelopeId`).

Flags:
- `--envelope-id <id>` (required; short id, longer prefix, or full UUID)
- `--token <token>` (optional; defaults to `HIBOSS_TOKEN`)

Output (parseable):
- `thread-max-depth: 20`
- `thread-total-count: <n>` (full chain length, including the root envelope)
- `thread-returned-count: <n>` (how many envelope blocks are printed)
- `thread-truncated: true|false`
- `thread-truncated-intermediate-count: <n>` (only when truncated)
- If `thread-returned-count > 0`, prints a blank line, then repeated envelope instruction blocks (same shape as `hiboss envelope list`), separated by a blank line.
- Thread output suppresses `in-reply-to-from-name:` and `in-reply-to-text:` fields (the chain ordering already provides this context).
- If truncated, prints a single marker line between the blocks:
  - `...<n intermediate envelopes truncated>...`

Default permission:
- `restricted`

## `hiboss envelope list`

Lists envelopes relevant to the authenticated agent.

Empty output:

```
no-envelopes: true
```

Rendering (default):
- Prints one envelope instruction per envelope, separated by a blank line.
- Each envelope is formatted by `formatEnvelopeInstruction()` using `prompts/envelope/instruction.md`.

Notes:
- Envelopes are marked `done` automatically by the daemon after successful delivery (channels) or immediately after being read for an agent run (agents, at-most-once).
- `hiboss envelope list` only lists envelopes where the authenticated agent is either the sender (`from: agent:<name>`) or the recipient (`to: agent:<name>`).
- Listing with `--from <address> --status pending` is treated as a work-queue read: the daemon returns **due** pending envelopes and immediately acknowledges what it returns (marks them `done`, at-most-once) so they won’t be reprocessed.
- Envelope instructions do not include a `status:` field; agents should rely on the `--status` flag they requested.
- Boss tokens cannot list envelopes (use an agent token).

Flags:
- Exactly one of:
  - `--to <address>`: list envelopes sent **by this agent** to `<address>`
  - `--from <address>`: list envelopes sent **to this agent** from `<address>`
- `--status <pending|done>` (required)
- `--created-after <time>` (optional; filter `created-at >= time`; ISO 8601 or relative `+2h`, `+30m`, `+1Y2M`, `-15m`; units: `Y/M/D/h/m/s`)
- `--created-before <time>` (optional; filter `created-at <= time`; same format as `--created-after`)
- `-n, --limit <n>` (default: `10`, max: `50`)

Validation:
- If both date filters are present, `created-after` must be less than or equal to `created-before`.

Default permission:
- `restricted`
